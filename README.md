# PokemonAnalysis_2022.1
 Reuploaded after corruption of old rProj.
Work for my first portfolio piece!

Variables we will be working with from the original dataset:
name (lists name of the Pokemon in English)
height_m (lists height of the Pokemon in meters)
weight_kg (lists weight of the Pokemon in kilograms)
capture_rate (lists the chance of catching the Pokemon at full health with a pokeball)
is_legendary (tells whether the Pokemon is legendary or not)

Possible values of variables:
height_m (0.1m to 14.5m)
weight_kg (0.1kg to 999.9kg)
capture_rate (1 to 34)
is_legendary (displays as 0, not legendary, or 1, legendary)

Missing data is displayed as NA.
